            <p><b>Search Free Games is a website where people can search for free gaming sites/games and have the option</br> to add on beyond 
                that. The purpose of this site is to be inclusive to those who struggle to play games that may cost money</br> or to those 
                who may come in contact with restrictions due to a location such as School. We hope you enjoy these recommendations</br> and 
                if you have questions/suggestions please contact us. Enjoy!</b></p>
