            <p>Search Free Games is a website where people can search for free gaming sites/games and have the option to add on beyond that. The purpose of this site is to be inclusive to those who struggle to play games that may cost money or to those who may come in contact with restrictions due to a location such as School. We hope you enjoy these recommendations and if you have questions/suggestions please contact us. Enjoy!</p>
