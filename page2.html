        <p><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hLESLXqBLI">Led Zeppelin IV</a></b></i> by <i><b>Led Zeppelin</b></i></p>
        <p> Led Zeppelin IV is considered to be the most recognizable when it comes to Led Zeppelin's whole discography. It is also very favorable
        when it comes to discussing best rock albums of all time. This album is very diverse with its sound ranging from distorted guitars to
        melodic acoustics. Many people consider this to be their peak due to every song being different from the other and still being a top
        hit. This album not only gets love from many music lovers but also beginner entry level listeners/musicians. My recommendation within
        this album would be "Stairway to Heaven" because it contains diverse ranges from the band starting off with a melodic folk sound and
        building up to a groovy rock listen (the song is about amassing wealth and power to earn an importance in life rather than living a
        good life). A favorite of my mine from this band would be "Babe I'm Going To Leave You" which on their first album and the reason I
        like it so much is because it properly represents that the band knows how to work with different sounds and their proper placements,
        such as with acoustics and electrics (this song is about just leaving someone). Other similar artists I would recommend would be
        Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, and Jimi Hendrix.</br>

        <p><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE8gISNPz7I">To Pimp a Butterfly</a></b></i> by <i><b>Kendrick Lamar</b></i></p>
        <p>To Pimp a Butterfly is one of the most well known albums and favorable within the Hip Hop & Rap genre. Even though this album is
        considered to be a Hip Hop & Rap album it has so much more different elements. This album in my opinion is so much diverse and
        experimental compared to the other albums this artist has produced. The other musical aspects include: jazz, experimental, funk, and
        soul. This album covers the difficulties that African-Americans face within the daily and the system. Not only is this album meant
        to relate to a person of similar decent it is also for those who cannot relate to understand. My recommendation within this album would
        be "Alright" because it covers the main content of what the album is about and that is the struggles that African-Americans may face on
        the daily and a personal favorite from the artist would be "FEAR." which is in the album "DAMN." It's my favorite it's something that
        can be relatable (it covers diverse situations in which we may experience throughout our life). Other similar artists recommendations
        would be Kanye West, J. Cole, Nas, and Tyler the Creator.</br>

        <p><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6LA7v1PApU">Master of Puppets</a></b></i> by <i><b>Metallica</b></i> </p>
        <p>Master of Puppets is considered to be one of the most well known albums in the whole metal genre and considered to be within
        the top 100 albums in the world by many music critics. This album in my opinion is Metallica's most well produced and also the most
        involved and active the group has been compared to their other albums/projects. This album contains different ranges of music aspects
        ranging from melodic to distorted. Metallica keeps a well balanced between those two aspects making it one of the reasons it is so
        popular and one of best entry level albums within this genre. My recommendation within this album would be the self titled song
        "Master of Puppets" because it covers the various different aspects of what the band produces musically and because of the deep
        meaning behind it (this song covers many aspects of addiction) and a personal favorite from the band would be "One" which is in their
        4th album "...And Justice for All". It is my personal favorite because it tells a dark story in a melodic tone and it slowly builds up
        to an intense tragedy reveal (this song tells a tragic story of the consequences that war may produce). Other band recommendations
        similar to this band would be Megadeth, Slayer, Exodus, and Sepultura.</br>

        <p><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDwcMbu8fBI">Nevermind</a></b></i> by <i><b>Nirvana</b></i> </p>
        <p>Nevermind is not only the most popular within the grunge genre it is also one of the most well known and popular albums
        of all time. Nirvana's nevermind covers many different aspects of various genres such as punk, melodic, metal, psychedelic, and
        so much more. In my opinion because of the various genres within it is why it is so popular to various music listeners.
        Although this album is one of the most mainstream of all time, it goes against the standards within the industry. Each song is
        diverse from the other and covers many dark elements ranging from self to society. My recommendation within this album would be
        "Smells Like Teen Spirit" since it is their most popular song and brings out the musical aspect of what Nirvana produced (this
        song is just about being a teen) and a personal favorite from the artist would be "Endless, Nameless" because it covers the musical
        aspect of my favorite genre, metal, and the dark atmosphere between the sound and lyrics, I also like it because it goes against the
        mainstream industry (this song is about all intense emotions, such as anger and frustration, and just letting it all out in
        the end). Other band recommendations similar to this band would be Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots, and Pearl Jam.</br>
