        <b> 1. Pop </b> 
        <p>Album: <i><b><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh_yhTyae08"><u>Pet Sounds</u></a></b></i> by <i><b>The Beach Boys</b></i></p> 
        <p> This album contains some of the most incredible moments of music that man (Brian Wilson) has ever composed. Pet Sounds has consistently
        been lauded as one of the greatest albums of all time, and it is certainly</br> deserving of that title even 55 years after its release.
        Pet Sounds is full of intricate melodies, stunning orchestrations, polyphonic harmonies, and beautiful lyrics, yet it remains very
        accesible for any</br> listener. The lyrics of songs such as "That's Not Me" and "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times", are very melancholic
        and have this sense of nostalgia that I've never heard replicated so well in any other music. Part of the reason</br> why I hold Pet Sounds
        in such high regard is because of how many perspectives the album can be listened from. Every song is so dense and full of sound,
        that I've "discovered" new melodies and</br> instruments from songs I have heard countless times. It's honestly pretty difficult
        for me to fully put into words how much this album means to me, it is incredible and you should absolutely go listen to it. </br>

        <p><b>2. Jazz/Classical</b></p>
        <p>Song: <i><b><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jVh5cZ_ZvM"><u>Rhapsody in Blue</u></a></b></i> by <i><b>George Gershwin</b></i></p>
        <p>Probably one of the most recognizable pieces of classical music and jazz, Rhapsody in Blue is uniquely American and paints
        a very vivid picture of New York City at the height of the Roaring 20's. It's energetic,</br> somewhat introspective, and full of 
        soul. My favorite part of the piece is the "Love Theme" around the 10 minute mark, it's more subdued than other parts of the 
        piece and has a very sentimental feel. There are a bunch </br>of pieces of classical music that I could have chose from, but I put
        Rhapsody in Blue here because it was one of the first pieces of music that I really became obsessed with, and it's one of the
        reasons why I learned to play an instrument</br> and it perfectly encapsulates what I love about music so much.
        </p></br>
        <p>Here are some pieces/composers similar to <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i>:</p>

        <p>- An American in Paris - George Gershwin</p>
        <p>- Symphony No. 9 "New World" - Antonin Dvorak</p>

        <p><b>3. Shoegaze</b></p>
        <p>Album: <i><b><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9jvzVuYRyY"><u>Ceres & Calypso in the Deep Time</u></a></b></i> by <i><b>Candy Claws</b></i> </p>
        <p>I've only first heard this album a bit more recently, but it has quickly become one of my favorites. A lot of the melodies
        and instrumentation remind me of Pet Sounds, actually. It's hard for</br> me to explain why, but songs like "New Forest(Five Heads
        of the Sun)" and "Fell in Love(At the Water)" have a very nostalgic quality to them, even if that was probably not the intent of
        the artist.</br> The melodies of these songs instantly transport me to my earliest childhood memories, even though none of these songs
        existed at that time. The album's lyrics are centered around Ceres and her seal companion Calypso, as they traverse through the Earth millions of years ago.

        <p>Here are some bands/songs/albums similar to <i>Ceres & Calypso in the Deep Time</i>:</p>

        <p>- Two Airships/Exploder Falls - Candy Claws</p>

        <p><b>4. Psychedelia</b></p>
        <p>Album: <i><b><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXZnW_wzROY"><u>Begin</u></a></b></i> by <i><b>The Millennium</b></i> </p>
        <p>This album is lighter than most psychedelic albums that came out around the same time, but it's still a super enjoyable record.
        Musically, it's pretty similar to Pet Sounds(maybe my music tastes </br>could just be described as Pet Sounds and anything that sounds
        like Pet Sounds) as it's got a lot of lush orchestrations, layered harmonies, and some folk sensibilites. Most of the lyrics 
        discuss mundane</br> topics, like the early morning or imaginary islands. They're perfectly fine though, songs don't need to have 
        self-conscious or deep messages. Anyways, Begin is a great album and I put it on my list because it's an album that most people most 
        likely haven't heard yet.
